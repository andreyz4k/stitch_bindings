Tutorial
========

We will assume you have already installed ``stitch_core``. If not, first see :doc:`intro/install`.

Lets do some basic abstraction learning. Here we'll two programs ``(a a a)`` and ``(b b b)`` and abstract out the common structure as a function ``Î»x. x x x``

>>> from stitch_core import compress
>>> programs = ["(a a a)", "(b b b)"]
>>> res = compress(programs, iterations=1)
>>> res.rewritten
['(fn_0 a)', '(fn_0 b)']
>>> res.abstractions[0].body
'(#0 #0 #0)'

Abstractions are given unique names ``fn_0``, ``fn_1``, etc., while arguments to these abstractions are represented as ``#0``, ``#1``, etc.

We could then rewrite a new set of programs using this same abstraction like so:
>>> from stitch_core import rewrite
>>> programs_to_rewrite = ["(c c c)", "(d d d)"]
>>> rewrite(programs_to_rewrite, res.abstractions)
['(fn_0 c)', '(fn_0 d)']


The full :py:func:`stitch_core.compress` function is given as:
.. autofunction:: stitch_core.compress

And may raise an exception if the Rust backend panics:

.. autoexception:: stitch_core.StitchException

or may raise a ``TypeError`` if incorrect argument types are provided.

The full :py:func:`stitch_core.rewrite` function is given as:
.. autofunction:: stitch_core.rewrite

The example from the Overview section of the `Stitch paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16605>`_ could be written as::
    programs = [
        "(lam (+ 3 (* (+ 2 4) 2)))",
        "(lam (map (lam (+ 3 (* 4 (+ 3 $0)))) $0))",
        "(lam (* 2 (+ 3 (* $0 (+ 2 1)))))"
    ]
    res = compress(programs, iterations=1, max_arity=2)
    assert res.abstractions[0].body == '(+ 3 (* #1 #0))'
    assert res.rewritten == [
        '(lam (fn_0 2 (+ 2 4)))',
        '(lam (map (lam (fn_0 (+ 3 $0) 4)) $0))',
        '(lam (* 2 (fn_0 (+ 2 1) $0)))'
        ]
